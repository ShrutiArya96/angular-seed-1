This repository contains a seed project for Angular 1 client applications written in ES5/ES6. It is part of the [Meanie](https://github.com/meanie/meanie) eco system, which is a collection of boilerplate code and libraries for developing, testing and building javascript applications using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node).

The build process for this seed project is powered by the Gulp 4 task runner.

## Installation
You can install this seed project either by manually cloning the repository, or by using the [Meanie CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meanie).

### Cloning from github
```shell
# Create empty project directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/meanie/angular-seed.git .

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Using the Meanie CLI
```shell
# Create empty project directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Seed a new Angular project
meanie seed angular
```

If you don't have the Meanie CLI tool installed, you can install it using:

```shell
npm install -g meanie
```

## Running the project
Once installed, you can run the project using:

```shell
npm start
```

This will build the app, launch lite-server and watch for file changes and rebuild as needed.

## Folder structure

The following is an outline of the folder structure of this seed project:

```shell
# This is where your client side Angular application resides.
# Everything in this folder should be explicitly specific to
# your application.
├─ app

  # Static assets for your application go here. This is a good
  # place to store fonts, images, pdf files, etc. Anything in here
  # will be copied as-is to the distribution folder.
  ├─ assets

  # This folder contains your applications main feature modules.
  ├─ components

    # The core application component
    ├─ app

    # The home module of your application. Feel free to rename to
    # anything that suits better (e.g. index, dashboard, ...)
    ├─ home

    # Any shared components (like interface elements) reside here.
    └─ shared

  # This folder contains the shared layout for your application.
  # It's a good place to store all common stylesheets.
  ├─ layout

  # Any shared services can go here.
  └─ services

# This folder contains build configuration as well as all the tasks
# and utilities required to build your project.
├─ build

# This folder contains your environment specific application config.
# The config files are in YAML for convenience and are parsed during
# the build process and compiled into an Angular `Config` module.
├─ config

# Distribution folder for compiled files (generated by gulp build).
└─ dist
```
